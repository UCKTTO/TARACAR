Functional issues with the TARACAR app:
- no prompt in how long or what characters are needed for the password in the register portion
- constant log in to the app makes the application difficult to access (actually, there's no point to having a log in page since there are no sensitive information saved inside the application)
- email text field does not allow auto-fill from phones (might need to adjust the type of text field)
- slow login speed
- AR is glitchy and does not recognize other pictures of landmarks (it only responds to one dominican photo but not others)
- BLISTT Map has very low resolution (consider the application of a Google Maps API limited to only the BLISTT area, with markers indicating where other landmarks are)
- clicking on markers on the landmarks does not show the entire landmark name and description (text is cropped)
- app should not automatically close

UI issues:
- change logo, fonts and color scheme!
- **there should be no animation on the home screen
- remove the gradients ples
- the tree arrows are disgusting

other suggestions:
- in the explore section from the homepage, merge all information of overview and geographic sections but categorize into each city (BLISTT)
